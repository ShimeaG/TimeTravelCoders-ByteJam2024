# Time Travel Coders ByteJam 2024
This is a time travel website made for the 2024 ByteJam at IHCC,
composed of various times in history with facts of the time period
and summarizations of the time period in general.

## Description 
For ByteJam this year we decided to make a website taking us through
time. We decided to let it be rather freeflow, with you being able 
go to various times in history at your own discretion, allowing
for a unique experience where you can go to any page at any time or
just not go to any.
